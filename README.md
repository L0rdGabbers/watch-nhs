# **The Wales and West Acute Transport for Children Service (WATCh) Bristol**
## **Site Overview**
The Wales and West Acute Transport for Children Service is an ambulance team responsible for the safe transportation of critically ill children across the South West England and South Wales jointly commissioned by NHS South West England Specialist Commissioning and Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC). 

The WATCh team's previous website was due a required update and had a number of technical issues that needed removing. The website is intended to provide the necessary documents for the transfer of children, but also contains guidelines on how to treat children in certain conditions and provides documents to parents whose own children are in WATCh care.

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
* Members of WATCh

​
### **User Stories:**
* As a user, I want to see learn who the WATCh team members are

​
### **Site Aims:**
* To provide all the necessary links to important WATCh files and sites
* To inform parents about the services WATCh provides when their child is being transferred to city another location to allow for proper care
* To offer the user an oppertunity to get in contact
​
### **Color Scheme:**
* For my primary colour, I chose purple rgb(127, 0, 127), to match the preexisting WATCh logo; along with a gold rgb(235, 189, 23) as a secondary colour seeing as it stands out but not too harshly
​
### **Typography**
* As per contractor's request, the only font used throughout the site is Ubuntu, the font used in their preexisting WATCh logo
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
