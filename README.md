# **The Wales and West Acute Transport for Children Service (WATCh) Bristol**
## **Site Overview**
The Wales and West Acute Transport for Children Service is an ambulance team responsible for the safe transportation of critically ill children across the South West England and South Wales jointly commissioned by NHS South West England Specialist Commissioning and Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC). 

The WATCh team's previous website was due a required update and had a number of technical issues that needed removing. The website is intended to provide the necessary documents for the transfer of children, but also contains guidelines on how to treat children in certain conditions and provides documents to parents whose own children are in WATCh care.

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
* Members of WATCh
* Paediatricians responsible for the transfer of a child to WATCh care
* Parents of Children in WATCh care
​
### **User Stories:**
* As a user, I want to see learn who the WATCh team members are
* As a user, I want to be able to access the WATCh team Drug Sheet required to provide proper care to my patients quickly and efficiently.
* As a user, I want to find the WATCh 24 hour hotline
* As a user, I want to acquire the WATCh transfer sheet
​
### **Site Aims:**
* To provide all the necessary links to important WATCh files and sites
* To inform parents about the services WATCh provides when their child is being transferred to city another location to allow for proper care
* To offer the user an oppertunity to get in contact
​
### **Color Scheme:**
* For my primary colour, I chose purple rgb(127, 0, 127), to match the preexisting WATCh logo; along with a gold rgb(235, 189, 23) as a secondary colour seeing as it stands out but not too harshly

​
### **Typography**
* As per contractor's request, the only font used throughout the site is Ubuntu, the font used in their preexisting WATCh logo
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**

### *Header*
* The header of each page contains two logos, one WATCh logo and one NHS logo
* Both logos are responsive

​
### *Navigation Bar*
* A responsive navigation bar that provides access to/from all pages on the site
* When a particular page is being accessed, the corresponding page name appears white to remind the user which page they are on
* When a navigation bar link is being hovered, the link will turn gold rgb(235, 189, 23)

* The about label contains a dropdown section providing the links to the "About Us" and "Team" pages
* Like the rest of the navigation bar, the dropdown section also has active and hovering qualities


### *Hamburger Navigation Menu*
* Should a user view this site on a mobile device, the navigation bar is replaced with a hamburger icon that provides links to/from all pages
* Just as the main navigation bar did, the hamburger dropdown menu is equipped with active and hover qualities

### *Main Section*
* Each page contains a main section which contains all of that particular page's information, necessary links and an accompanying photo

<img src="docs/readme_images/about_us_page.png">

* Many of these pages contain a button or series of buttons that provide links to .pdf files, edexcel files, or other pages of this site
* All buttons have will turn gold rgb(235, 189, 23) when hovered over

* On the referrals, drug sheet, guidelines, family, and contact pages, which are more functional than decorational, the accompanying image will dissapear when the page width is below 950px.

* Both logos are responsive 
* At the very bottom is grey bar which contains copyright details to WATCh as well as credits for myself

​


## **Future-Enhancements**
​
### *STOPP Form*
* The STOPP form is a crucial part of patient transfer, which I have currently included as button link to the pdf file on the index page. One area for improvement, however, could be to include an interactive STOPP form page on the website with its own database to transfer patients more efficiently.

## **Testing Phase**
​
### *Responsiveness*
* I used my ASUS TUF DASH F15 to write and test the site during the development phase and used Chrome Dev Tools to test for initial responsiveness with great success
* After the intial testing was complete, I used my iPhone 8+ to test whether the responsive coding worked across devices and only encountered one issue to be described later.
